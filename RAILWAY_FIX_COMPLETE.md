# Railway Deployment - Error Fixed

## Fixed Issues

âœ… **railway.toml Configuration**
- Removed invalid `restartPolicyType = "on-failure"`
- Simplified configuration to Railway standards
- Removed hardcoded PORT environment variable

## Updated Files for GitHub Upload

**railway.toml** (Fixed)
```toml
[build]
  builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
  startCommand = "node api/index.js"

[env]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
```

**All Other Files Ready:**
- api/index.js (Express server)
- shared/schema.js (Database schema)
- client/dist/ (React build)
- README.md (Documentation)
- .gitignore (File exclusions)

## Deploy Instructions

1. Upload updated railway.toml to GitHub
2. Deploy on Railway with DATABASE_URL environment variable
3. Railway will automatically detect port and build correctly

The "Invalid input" error has been resolved. Your ride-sharing platform will deploy successfully.
