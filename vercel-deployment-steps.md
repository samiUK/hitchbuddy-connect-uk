# Complete Vercel Deployment Process

## Where to Run Commands
All `npx vercel` commands are run here in your Replit environment, NOT in Vercel dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Authentication (Current Step)
```bash
npx vercel login
```
- This opens authentication in your browser
- Choose GitHub (recommended) or email
- Complete authentication in the browser popup

### 2. Deploy Your Application
```bash
npx vercel --prod --yes
```
- This uploads and builds your app on Vercel's servers
- Creates production deployment
- Provides you with a live URL

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In Vercel Dashboard (web interface):
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your newly deployed project
3. Click Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your Supabase connection string
   - `NODE_ENV`: production

### 4. Redeploy (if needed)
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```
- Only needed if environment variables were added after deployment

## Current Status
- Your app is fully configured with Supabase database
- All build issues have been resolved
- Ready for production deployment

## What Happens Next
Once deployed, your Hitchbuddy app will be live at:
`https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
