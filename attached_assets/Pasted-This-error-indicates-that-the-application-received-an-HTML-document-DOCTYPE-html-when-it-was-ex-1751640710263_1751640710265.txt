This error indicates that the application received an HTML document (<!DOCTYPE html>) when it was expecting a JSON response. The SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' occurs because the JSON parser encountered the opening angle bracket of the HTML doctype declaration instead of a valid JSON character like { or [. This typically happens when an API request fails and the server responds with an HTML error page instead of a JSON error object.

Suggested fix
Examine the network request that resulted in this error. The error message Auth check failed suggests an authentication issue. The server likely returned an HTML login page or an error page related to authentication failure.

Inspect Network Requests: Use the "Network" tab in Chrome DevTools to identify the request that failed with a non-200 status code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error).
Analyze the Response: Check the "Response" tab for the failed request. It will likely contain the HTML content that caused the JSON parsing error.
Address the Authentication Issue: Determine why the authentication failed. This could be due to missing or incorrect credentials, an expired token, or insufficient permissions. Fix the underlying authentication problem in your application.
Once the authentication issue is resolved and the server returns a valid JSON response for the request, the error should disappear.

Summary
The error "Auth check failed: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON" means your application received an HTML response (likely an error page) when it expected JSON, probably due to an authentication failure. Fix the authentication issue to resolve the error.
