This request to https://hitchbuddyapp.replit.app/ is failing, indicated by the status code 0.

Here's a breakdown of potential issues:

Status Code 0: A status code of 0 in Chrome DevTools usually indicates a network error that prevented the request from completing. This can be due to various reasons, including:
Cross-Origin Issues (CORS): If this request is being made from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the origin serving the current page, and the server is not configured to allow requests from that origin, the browser will block the response, resulting in a status 0. The Referer header shows the request originated from https://replit.com/, which is likely a different origin than https://hitchbuddyapp.replit.app/.
Network Connectivity Problems: There might be an issue with the client's internet connection or a problem reaching the server.
Browser Extensions: Some browser extensions can interfere with network requests and cause failures.
Security Software/Firewalls: Local security software or firewalls might be blocking the request.
Server-Side Issues: While less likely to result in a status 0 (usually you'd get a server error like 5xx), it's possible the server crashed or is completely unresponsive.
Timing Information: The "Duration" of 21.08 seconds is very long, especially with a status 0. This suggests the browser waited for a significant amount of time for a response that never arrived or was blocked. The lack of "Connection start (stalled)" information might indicate the issue occurred before the TCP connection was fully established or at the very beginning of the request process.
To debug this, you should investigate the following:

Check the browser console for CORS errors: Look for messages related to "Cross-Origin Request Blocked" or similar.
Verify network connectivity: Ensure your internet connection is stable.
Disable browser extensions temporarily: See if the request succeeds with extensions disabled.
Check security software settings: Ensure your firewall or antivirus is not blocking the connection.
Try accessing the URL directly in the browser: See if the server is accessible and responding. If it is, the issue is likely client-side or related to how the request is being made.
Inspect the server logs (if you have access): See if the request even reached the server and if there are any errors recorded on the server side.
Based on the Referer header, CORS is the most likely cause of this failure. The server at https://hitchbuddyapp.replit.app/ needs to be configured to allow cross-origin requests from https://replit.com/.
