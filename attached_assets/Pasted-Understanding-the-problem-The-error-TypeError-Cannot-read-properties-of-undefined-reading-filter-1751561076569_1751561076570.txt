Understanding the problem
The error TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter') indicates that the code is trying to call the filter method on a variable that is currently undefined. In JavaScript, the filter method is a built-in method available on arrays. This error suggests that somewhere in the function Wt (likely within the minified code indicated by index-BotK2RZH.js), a variable that was expected to be an array is undefined, and the code is attempting to use the filter method on it.

Suggested fix
Since the error occurs in minified code (index-BotK2RZH.js), it's difficult to pinpoint the exact line and variable causing the issue without debugging the minified code. The provided code snippet itself doesn't directly use filter. The problem likely originates from data being processed or accessed within the Wt function which is being called by or related to the Console.js module where the Mt.forEach.n.<computed> part of the stack trace points.

To fix this, you will need to:

Identify the code calling Wt: Examine the code around where Wt is called or related to in Console.js (line 61).
Debug Wt: Use Chrome DevTools to step through the execution of the Wt function to see which variable is undefined when filter is called.
Trace the source of the undefined variable: Determine why the variable is undefined. This could be due to:
An incorrect API response.
Missing data in an object or array.
A variable not being initialized correctly.
An asynchronous operation not completing before the data is accessed.
Implement a check or provide a default value: Once the source is found, you can add a check to ensure the variable is an array before calling filter, or provide a default empty array if the data is expected but missing.
Without the code for Wt and the context of how it's being called, a specific code fix cannot be provided.

Summary
The error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter') means you're trying to use the filter method on something that is not an array and is currently undefined. This is happening within a minified function Wt. To fix this, you need to debug the execution of Wt to find the undefined variable, understand why it's undefined, and then add checks or provide default values before attempting to call filter.
