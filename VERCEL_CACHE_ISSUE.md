# Vercel Cache Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
Vercel is serving cached content from 48 minutes ago instead of your latest deployment. The response shows `x-vercel-cache: HIT` indicating cached TypeScript source code.

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Force Redeploy (Recommended)
- Go to vercel.com dashboard
- Find your hitchbuddy project  
- Click "Deployments" tab
- Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
- **Important**: Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"

### 2. Clear All Caches
- In Vercel project settings
- Go to "Functions" tab
- Clear function cache
- Go to "Storage" and clear edge cache

### 3. GitHub Webhook Fix
- Check if GitHub webhook is properly connected
- Make a small commit to trigger fresh deployment
- Or push an empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Force deploy"`

## Root Cause
Vercel's CDN is aggressively caching your old deployment. The build cache contains the TypeScript source code version instead of the fixed CommonJS version.

## Alternative: Switch to Railway
Since Vercel has persistent caching issues with your deployment, Railway will provide immediate deployment without cache complications.

Upload your files to GitHub and connect to railway.app for instant deployment.
