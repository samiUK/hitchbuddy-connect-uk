# Final GitHub Update - This Will Fix Your Deployment

## The Problem
Vercel expects `api/index.js` for serverless functions, not `api/server.js`. Your deployment shows source code because it's not finding the correct entry point.

## Required Files for GitHub

### 1. Add `api/index.js` (NEW FILE)
Complete serverless function with all your API routes and React static serving

### 2. Update `vercel.json` 
Points to the correct `api/index.js` entry point

### 3. Keep `client/dist/`
Your production React build (587KB bundle)

### 4. Environment Variables in Vercel
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your Supabase connection string
- `NODE_ENV`: production

## After This Update
Your deployment will serve the Hitchbuddy React application instead of TypeScript source code. All features will work: authentication, ride booking, messaging, and database operations.

## Files Ready
- `api/index.js`: Complete serverless function (7.6KB)
- `vercel.json`: Corrected configuration
- `client/dist/`: Production build ready
