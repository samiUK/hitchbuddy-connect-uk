# Vercel Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The Vercel deployment was showing source code instead of the built React application.

## Fix Applied
1. Updated `api/server.js` to serve static files from `client/dist`
2. Added catch-all route handler to serve `index.html` for non-API routes
3. This ensures proper Single Page Application (SPA) behavior

## Code Changes
```javascript
// Serve static files from client/dist
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist')));

// Catch-all handler: send back React's index.html file for any non-API routes
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist/index.html'));
});
```

## Deployment Status
- Redeploying to production with `--yes` flag
- Environment variables already configured
- Application should now serve the built React app instead of source code
