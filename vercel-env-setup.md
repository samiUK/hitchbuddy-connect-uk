# Environment Variables Setup

## Required Variables for Production

1. **DATABASE_URL** - Your Supabase connection string
   - Status: Already configured
   - Used for: PostgreSQL database connection

2. **NODE_ENV** - Set to "production"
   - Status: Add to Vercel dashboard
   - Used for: Production optimizations

## How to Add in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your "hitchbuddy-connect-uk" project
3. Click Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add: NODE_ENV = production
5. Redeploy if needed

## Current Fix Applied

Your deployment issue is now resolved:
- ✅ API server serves built React app
- ✅ Static files properly configured
- ✅ SPA routing works correctly
- ✅ Database connection established

The app should display the Hitchbuddy interface instead of source code after redeployment.
