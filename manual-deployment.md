# Manual Deployment Alternative

Since CLI authentication requires browser interaction, here's how to deploy manually:

## Option 1: Direct Upload
1. Build the application locally
2. Upload files directly to Vercel dashboard
3. Configure environment variables

## Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Auto-deploy from GitHub

## Current Build Status
- Application: Ready for production
- Database: Supabase connected
- API: Serverless functions configured
- Frontend: React build optimized

## Files Ready for Deployment
- client/dist/* (frontend build)
- api/server.js (serverless function)
- vercel.json (deployment config)

## Environment Variables Needed
- DATABASE_URL: Your Supabase connection string
- NODE_ENV: production

Your Hitchbuddy application is fully configured and ready for deployment through any of these methods.
