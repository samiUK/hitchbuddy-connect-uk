# Railway Deployment - Recommended Solution

## Why Railway Over Vercel
Railway provides superior full-stack Node.js support for your ride-sharing application with session management, real-time features, and database operations.

## GitHub Repository Setup

Upload these files to your repository:

1. **package.json** - Replace with package-github.json content
2. **railway.toml** - Platform configuration  
3. **api/index.js** - Complete Express.js server
4. **shared/schema.js** - Database schema
5. **client/dist/** - React production build

## Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Go to railway.app
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your hitchbuddy repository

2. **Environment Variables**

   - Railway auto-detects Node.js and uses railway.toml

3. **Deploy**
   - Railway automatically builds and deploys
   - Provides custom domain immediately
   - No caching issues like Vercel
